FAQ / Examples
Q1. Can I run the game/app as-is on my PC?
A1. Yes. Running the unmodified program for personal use is allowed.

Q2. Can I read the code to learn and copy a few lines into my private notes?
A2. Yes, for private learning only, and your notes must not be shared or published. Avoid verbatim large chunks.

Q3. Can I fork the repo or upload the code to my own repo or a Gist (even private)?
A3. No. No copying, hosting, mirroring, or reuploading—public or private.

Q4. Can I modify the code for my own project or merge parts into another codebase?
A4. No. No modifications, derivatives, ports, or merges are allowed.

Q5. Can I stream or post screenshots/videos of the unmodified program running?
A5. Generally yes, showing the program in use is fine. Do not share the code or any binaries; comply with any project asset/trademark guidance.

Q6. Can my company use this internally or as inspiration for a product?
A6. No, commercial and internal commercial tooling uses are forbidden. Reading to learn personally is fine; using code or ideas directly in a product is not permitted.

Q7. Can I use this code to train or benchmark an AI model, or include it in a dataset/embeddings?
A7. No. Absolutely no AI/ML training, fine-tuning, benchmarking, evaluation, dataset creation, or embeddings.
