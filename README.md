## 🧠 About  
This project is a Python-based learning game that explores **raycasting** to simulate 3D environments — similar to the early classics *DOOM* and *Wolfenstein 3D*.  
It’s a fully playable prototype built from scratch using **Pygame**, focused on understanding core rendering logic, collision, and movement in pseudo-3D space.

## 🚀 How to Start  
1. Download the repository as a **.zip** file  
2. Extract the folder  
3. Run the game with:  
   ```bash
   python main.py


or just open the folder and run the main.py
