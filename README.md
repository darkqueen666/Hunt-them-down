# Hunt Them Down 🖤

A gothic raycast shooter in Python (Pygame).

**Requirements:** Windows 10/11 (64-bit). No Python needed.

## 🎮 Controls  
`WASD` — Move  
`Mouse` — Look around  
`ESC` — Close Game  

## 🧠 About  
This project is a Python-based learning game that explores **raycasting** to simulate 3D environments — similar to the early classics *DOOM* and *Wolfenstein 3D*.  
It’s a fully playable prototype built from scratch using **Pygame**, focused on understanding core rendering logic, collision, and movement in pseudo-3D space.

## 🚀 How to Start  
1. Download the latest **HuntThemDown-windows-x64.zip** from **Releases**.
2. Unzip and run `HuntThemDown.exe`.
3. If SmartScreen appears: *More info → Run anyway*.
